# Outline of Current Focus 2/20/22

## 1. Udemy JavaScript Course

I am about 1/3 of the way through the Complete JavaScript Course on Udemy taught by Jonas Schemedtmann.  
I am taking my time and going back to review often as well as creating my own projects along the way.

## 2. Codewars Practice

I have an account on codewars.com where I periodically complete challenges to further ingrain the concepts and 
ideas into my brain. This has been a very helpful resource.
