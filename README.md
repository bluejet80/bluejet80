# Outline of Current Focus 08/15/25

## Current Projects

### 1. Journal Website
I have been journaling since I was 20. I have over 30 journals with over 4400 pages of written text. All the journals have been digitized and I have made first line indexes for the pages. I converted google docs into JSON and loaded the data into a MYSQL database. And the I created an API in Express to get the data from the database and display it on a javascript frontend. I am adding the functionality to add commentary and categories to each page.

### 2. Posterize Script 
Bash Script to slice images into smaller squares to create large format art. I wanted to be able to take an image and tell the script the size I want the blown up result to be and it automatically slices it into rectangles proportionate to 8.5 x 11 sheets of paper. Then I can print them out and glue the sheets together to create the larger image. It outputs a PDF.
